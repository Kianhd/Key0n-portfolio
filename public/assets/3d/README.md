# 3D Assets Required

This directory should contain the following 3D model files for the FluidGlass component:

- `lens.glb` - Lens/cylinder shaped glass model
- `bar.glb` - Bar shaped glass model  
- `cube.glb` - Cube shaped glass model

You can download example models from the React Bits repository or create your own using:
- Blender (free, open-source)
- Spline (web-based 3D tool)
- Three.js editor

The models should be in GLB format (GLTF binary) for optimal loading performance.
